# LEVEL 7

Same as the previous level, there is a delay before we receive the encrypted flag, and the encrypted flag differs each time. Seems like there is prime generation going on in the background again. Once again, I tried encrypting 00, 01, and 02 again. The former resulted in 0 and 1 again like before, but the latter resulted in a rather large number. It seems like it's still a power though, so we can take the log base 2 of the encryption of 2 to get that power. Trying this on multiple connections showed that this power varied, seemingly between around 60 and 150. In any case, it's not huge, so sage's nth_root can handle it fine.

Once again, the task is then to find the prime which is the modulo. I tried using the same semi-lazy approach as before(in retrospect, it definitely would have been simpler to just use the GCD method), which failed since multiplying a number by 256 and raising that to a high power would, as expected, result in a huge number, so the difference message^3 - result became very difficult to factor. I opted to just increase my messages's values by a small value at a time(multiplying by 1.1, converting to int, then to hexstring) from a base value of 256 so that the encryption result would still be small. It's not pretty, but it worked. The rest is the same as the previous level.

The flag is ``zh3r0{17_a1n7_much_bu7_1_4m_s0m37h1ng_0f_4_cryp74n4ly57_my53lf}``
