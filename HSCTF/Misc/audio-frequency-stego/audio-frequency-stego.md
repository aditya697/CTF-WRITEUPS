# audio-frequency-stego

i initially used audacity to see the wave is spectrogram, i found that there are only 2 frequencies frequently repating

on noting dwon the first frequecy as 0 and second frequency as 1 i found some binary encoding strings. On fecoding that binary i got the flag

Flag:- ``flag{sl1gh_p1tch_ch4ng3}``
