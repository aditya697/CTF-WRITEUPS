# Spelling test

We are given a large `.txt` file which has soo many words in it.

The challenge description says there few spelling mistakes.

If we keep correcting and noting the changed words it forms the flag.

So i have copy pasted the entire file in word document.

In a word document we get a red underline for the wrong words.

So i searched for all of them and i found these,

```
translatcr
approachfs
subscrybers
endangored
modufications
rehapilitation
classisal
munisipality
engineereng
recruitmeht
yorkshere
applicasions
broadcesting
attractlve
obituarles
bibliogriphy
avainable
instructiongl
strengthenint
discherge
subscriptisn
copyrightet
```

```
wrong letters     :- c f y o u p s s e h e s e l l i n g t e s t
changed letters to:- o e i e i b c c i n i t a i i a l a g a o d
```

So I might have missed few wrong words, with letters that we got till now we can form meaningful sentence.

FLAG:- ``ictf{youpassesthespellingtest}``
